## Assistive Technologies (AT) and Information Communication Technologies (ICT)

*   **AT:** Tools and devices designed to help individuals with disabilities perform tasks and participate in daily life.
*   **ICT:** Technologies that provide access to information and communication, such as computers, internet, mobile devices, and software applications.
*   **Intersection:**  Understanding how AT and ICT intersect is crucial for creating accessible digital experiences. ICT should be compatible with and usable by various AT.

# Assistive Technologies for Visual Impairments

## Screen Readers

*   Software that converts text and interface elements into speech or braille.
*   Examples: JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, Orca
*   [NV Access - NVDA Screen Reader](https://www.nvaccess.org/)
*   [Freedom Scientific - JAWS Screen Reader](https://www.freedomscientific.com/training/jaws/)

## Magnification Software

*   Enlarges portions of the screen to make content easier to see.
*   Examples: ZoomText, Windows Magnifier, macOS Zoom

## Braille Displays

*   Electronic devices that display text in braille, often used with screen readers.
*   Provides tactile access to digital information.


# Assistive Technologies for Auditory Impairments

## Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs)

*   Amplify and clarify sound for individuals with hearing loss.
*   Types: Hearing aids, cochlear implants, FM systems, induction loops.

## Captioning and Subtitles

*   Textual representation of audio content in videos and live events.
*   Essential for accessibility of multimedia content.

# Assistive Technologies for Motor Impairments

## Switch Devices

*   Allow users to interact with technology using alternative input methods.
*   Activated by various movements: buttons, head switches, sip-and-puff.

## Eye-Gaze Systems

*   Track eye movements to control a computer cursor or other devices.
*   Enables hands-free interaction for individuals with limited mobility.

# Assistive Technologies for Cognitive & Speech Impairments

## Text-to-Speech (TTS)

*   Synthesizes spoken words from digital text.
*   Benefits individuals with reading difficulties or speech impairments.
*   Often integrated into screen readers and other applications.
*   [ReadSpeaker - Text to Speech Solutions](https://www.readspeaker.com/)

## Reading Aids

*   Tools to support reading comprehension and fluency.
*   Examples:  dyslexia fonts, text highlighting, line readers, optical character recognition (OCR).

## Memory Aids

*   Devices and software to assist with memory and organization.
*   Examples:  Reminder apps, digital calendars, note-taking software, voice recorders.

# Testing with Assistive Technologies

## Why Test with AT?

*   Ensures real-world accessibility for users who rely on these tools.
*   Identifies usability issues that may not be apparent through other testing methods.
*   Validates conformance with accessibility standards.

##  Testing Methods

*   **Manual Testing:**  Involving users with disabilities who use AT to test the ICT.
*   **Automated Testing:**  Tools can check for some types of AT compatibility issues, but manual testing is crucial.
*   **Usability Testing:** Observe users with disabilities using AT to complete tasks within the ICT.

##  Common AT for Testing

*   **Screen Readers:**  NVDA, JAWS (common for web accessibility testing)
*   **Magnification Software:**  Built-in OS magnifiers
*   **Keyboard-only Navigation:** Testing without a mouse
*   **Voice Control:** Operating systems' built-in voice control features

# AT Related Legislation

##  Examples of Legislation

*   **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (USA):** Mandates accessibility in various areas, including ICT in some contexts.
    *   [ADA.gov](https://www.ada.gov/)
*   **Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (USA):** Requires federal agencies to make their ICT accessible.
    *   [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/)
*   **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) (Canada):**  Provincial legislation with ICT accessibility standards.
    *   [Ontario.ca - Accessibility Laws](https://www.ontario.ca/page/accessibility-laws)
*   **European Accessibility Act (EAA) (EU):**  Sets accessibility requirements for a range of products and services, including ICT.
    *   [European Commission - European Accessibility Act](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202)

##  Importance of Legislation

*   Provides legal frameworks to ensure accessibility.
*   Drives development and procurement of accessible ICT and AT.
*   Promotes inclusivity and equal access for people with disabilities.
